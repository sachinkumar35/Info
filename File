Cucumber is a widely used testing tool that supports Behavior Driven Development (BDD) by allowing tests to be written in a natural language style. When executing scenarios, reports can be generated to provide insights into the test results. Here's a comprehensive guide on configuring and generating reports in different formats:

### Cucumber Options Configuration:

#### 1. **Pretty:**
   - Provides verbose output.
   - Syntax: `@CucumberOptions(plugin = "pretty")`

#### 2. **Monochrome:**
   - Helps improve console output readability.
   - Syntax: `@CucumberOptions(monochrome = true)`

#### 3. **Usage:**
   - Provides the time taken by each Step Definition.
   - Syntax: `@CucumberOptions(plugin = "usage")`

### Report Formats:

#### 4. **HTML Reports:**
   - Generate HTML reports using the following syntax:
     ```java
     @CucumberOptions(plugin = "html:target/cucumber-reports")
     ```

#### 5. **XML Reports:**
   - Generate XML reports using JUnit syntax:
     ```java
     @CucumberOptions(plugin = "junit:target/cucumber-reports/cucumber.xml")
     ```

#### 6. **JSON Reports:**
   - Generate JSON reports using the syntax:
     ```java
     @CucumberOptions(plugin = "json:target/cucumber-reports/Cucumber.json")
     ```

### Online Cucumber Reports:

#### 7. **Cucumber.properties File:**
   - Create an entry in the `cucumber.properties` file:
     ```
     cucumber.publish.enabled=true
     ```

#### 8. **Environment Variable:**
   - Declare an environment variable:
     ```
     CUCUMBER_PUBLISH_ENABLED=true
     ```

#### 9. **JUnit Runner Class:**
   - Specify in the JUnit runner class using `@CucumberOptions`:
     ```java
     @CucumberOptions(publish = true)
     ```

### Online Reporting Output:
   - On execution, a message will appear in the console:
     ```
     Share your Cucumber Report with your team at https://reports.cucumber.io
     ```

This comprehensive setup allows you to configure Cucumber options for better console output and generate reports in HTML, XML, and JSON formats, with the added option to share reports online for collaborative testing efforts.
